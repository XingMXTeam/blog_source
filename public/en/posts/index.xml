      <description>Learning Methods 721 Principle: The &amp;ldquo;721&amp;rdquo; learning rule was formally introduced by Morgan, Robert and Mike in their book &amp;ldquo;Building a Career Development Plan&amp;rdquo;, and is summarized as follows.
 70% learning by doing (practice) 20% learning from others (review, summarize, share and exchange) 10% self-learning (input: training, books)  The methodology is simple.
input: what quality sources of information you have, this needs to be consciously collected, more books, training, join the bullying platform, contact more people, but also have an open mind</description>

      <description>Question Definition (S &amp;amp; T) Given an undirected graph, how to check if there is a cycle in the graph ?
Example 1:
Input：n = 4 , e = 4, the edges = { 0 1, 1 2, 2 3, 0 2 }
Output: yes
Diagram:
 has circle
  Example 2:
Input: n = 4, e = 3, the edges: { 0 1, 1 2, 2 3 }</description>

      <description>Coding principles  Computers are by nature a world of 0/1, and if expressing this world in 0/1. The conclusion is: it needs to be encoded by.
 Number encoding  First how to express numbers
 ** Why is there a complement code? **
 Complement is to facilitate computer operations, it is easier for computers to do addition
 For example: 5+(-3) is calculated by complement (definition: positive number remains the same, negative number is inverted and +1)</description>

      <description>Question Definition (S &amp;amp; T) Given N, Find the total number of unique BSTs that can be made using values from 1 to N
Examples:
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
For n = 3, preorder traversal of
 1 2 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 3 1 2 3 2 1  Input: 4
Output: 14
Problem Analysis(A) At first, I did not quite understand what the question means.</description>
