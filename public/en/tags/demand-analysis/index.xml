      <description>Why define the question Without a clear definition of the problem, decisions cannot be made and good results, such as great products and solutions, cannot be produced. Albert Einstein said: &amp;ldquo;It is more important to ask a question than to solve a problem.
What does a problem mean? A problem is a contradiction in things, a mismatch
There are several general characteristics.
1 Universality: it is ordinary existence
2 Movement: in constant flux, what is a problem now may become not a problem later or the problem may become another; the point of the problem is different at different stages.</description>
