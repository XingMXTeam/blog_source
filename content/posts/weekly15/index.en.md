I am more concerned about the financial growth thinking such as investment, startup products, etc., and I have been following the big Twitter V levelsio before.
Picture he is a very powerful free entrepreneur, can independently run a lot of products, business ability and product ability are very outstanding. This is not he recently wrote a book "make bootstrappers handbook", online link readmake.com.


Because he admires his ability to take action and continue to Make, I read this book, and after reading it, I did have some gains (reading alone is useless, we still need to take action), so I'll share it with you.

This book is more content, I look at the version of the missing some of the content, but the general directory platform to see how to start, practice, and the introduction of some tools, for me, is a good access to the manual.

## Core takeaways 

### Idea validation

Gather your own ideas, start with a problem you've encountered, make sure they're small enough to be executable, and rank a lot of ideas, in order of what you'd like to do the most.

What if you don't have an idea? Actively experience different things to be original yourself. Actively share your ideas, don't be afraid of idea plagiarism, the key is action.

Go from micro niche to multi niche, from vertical to platform. Don't start out trying to get a big one.

Tools:

Zapier: design tool  
Typeform: form tool   
WordPress: website builder  
MailChimp: marketing, automation and email platforms  
Google Analytics  
MixPanel: Product Analytics  
Amplitude: Product Analytics  
Hotjar: Product Analytics  
AWS Simple Email (SES doesn't always treat as spam, needs to be set up correctly) / postmark/ SendGrid / Cloudflare works (free email, MailChannels to avoid going into spam): email delivery services    

## Build

Fast and minimal. Use tools to build MVPs quickly to validate your ideas and definitely to reduce build costs.

Don't get tool-obsessed.

Recommend web first, web and Native will converge in the future. Cloud servers are relatively inexpensive, about $5/minute, much cheaper than Native development.

Realise product ideas by combining APIs.

No need for office space, anytime, anywhere. No need for money and investment instead may be your advantage as you 100% own your product.

Tools:

Linode: Virtual Private Server  
Digital Ocean: Virtual Private Server  
Heroku: Platform as a Service  
Ubuntu  
Nginx: You can set a default server  
JavaScript  
Olark: Website chat tool  
twilio: Website chat tool  
ClickUp: Project Management

## Launch

Aim for a 2 week launch, to fix most of the bugs in your app (make sure the product is bug free and that new users can understand its content and start using it right away.) , add email, push notifications, have analytics and feedback.

Start with a small niche, like friends, and expand gradually. Constant releases through feedback, the ability to submit directly to the line, direct resolution of issues, and quick validation are key.

If your product doesn't inspire you to move on, drop it.

Other channels to get feedback:

- Email journalists for news stories (find journalists at https://submit.co/), make sure it's concise and doesn't look like spam.

- Writing personalised launch product descriptions for each platform.
- Blog writing: textual approach to writing, not utilitarian in nature. Modern media is very advanced, so try to use it to express yourself, fewer people read blogs, but they are still there. For example, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Little Red Book and other domestic apps

## Growth
 
Constantly update releases, tell stories, build publicly, and make it easy for people to share (easy to read urls and slugs). Can build with users, create APIs, and find advantages over competitors.  

## Monetisation
 
Collecting money is validation, don't be afraid to do so. Build with monetisation in mind. Pay per feature, or adverts, sponsorships, subscription models, community models, conditional payments.  

Subscriptions are better than single payments, even when considering cancellations. What can be subscribed: a service, a forum, a chat group, a social network for a specific niche. Of course, it's also better to offer a lifetime subscription, which is roughly what the customer's Lifetime Value (LTV) is x the average time of use, to calculate the one-time payment amount. People no longer like to pay for content, but prefer to pay for connections. Subscription payments are particularly well suited to business models that build communities, which can be discussion boards, forums, chat groups, social networks to physical gatherings.

This includes quick top-ups using Typeform, how refunds and bookkeeping work and tax issues. Domestic companies do not need an ICP licence to access online payments (unless third party onboarding is involved)

Tools:

Stripe  
Braintree  
Paypal

## Register your company
 
When your users reach a certain size can consider registering a company, of course, you can also apply for an individual business (limited functionality, unlimited liability). Although the cost of paying for the registration of the company in the early stage, but the benefits are:

- Apply for a variety of third-party services convenient (payment, etc.)  
- Can take some other services invoicing is convenient, low tax rate. (Courses/consulting/advertising)  
- Various cloud service platforms will have various discounts for enterprise certification.  

Comparison of Company Incorporation Fees:  

Setting up an overseas company:

https://stripe.com/en-jp/atlas One-time setup fee $500 + $100 registered agent per year

Mainland company:

Finance fee of about 300 a month, on behalf of the accounts, social security and other chores (low there is 200 a month, consider the tax risk) + 1500 annual audit; financial agents within 2,000, a year of agency registration of the company/agent bookkeeping and so on about 6k.

Hong Kong company: about 5200 financial fees a year, + 1500 annual review.  
Domestic registered companies: the best way to register is to consult your neighbourhood business parks, there will be supporting services, the cost is lower. Address hanging industrial park. Now does not support the individual sole proprietorship (do not have to pay social security to themselves), is a small-scale tax.
