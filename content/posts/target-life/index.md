## A little emotion

 21 years I bought a house in Hangzhou to put down roots, in a trance, has been 32, work in general, life in general, not so exciting, most of the time as the walking dead. When I was young, I did my best to feel the splendor of life, and when I was old, my children and grandchildren were full of children and grandchildren, and I did not suffer from physical illnesses, so I did not have any regrets.

## Cut to the chase


There is a saying that there is no dream and what is the difference between a salted fish. All dreams need to be rooted in reality, otherwise it is a pavilion in the sky, a fool's dream. In reality, to draw the joy of life. And work is a large part of life, the degree of happiness in the workplace determines the degree of happiness in your life. Think of your career as a journey and experience it deeply instead of feeling that work is a waste of time and life. The following is my workplace trajectory.

Work in a routine, no breakthrough in the workplace promotion. But also slowly to a large platform, is the opportunity to break through upwards or make some achievements. There is no chapter, need to pay more attention to interests and hobbies, to inspire their own work passion. Need to develop good habits, through the scientific method, management of self.

[Work] Core to improve coding and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to land on the job, need to have a strong attitude and upward drive.

[Family] Start a family as soon as possible. The people and things in the past can only be remembered, not changed. Running into the future is the only way out, and a stable family is the foundation for a successful career.

[Personal] Positive energy, continuous learning, input, output. Enhance self-awareness, make friends, be more interesting and more compatible with others.

Why have a growth flywheel, because without theoretical guidance, it is difficult to form a fighting force. Drive self through growth closed loop: the core is to have a Polaris goal every year, then develop a strategy to implement it and drive it through habit.
