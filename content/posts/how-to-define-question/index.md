## Why define the question

Without a clear definition of the problem, decisions cannot be made and good results, such as great products and solutions, cannot be produced. Albert Einstein said: "It is more important to ask a question than to solve a problem.

## What does a problem mean?

A problem is a contradiction in things, a mismatch

There are several general characteristics.  
1 Universality: it is ordinary existence  
2 Movement: in constant flux, what is a problem now may become not a problem later or the problem may become another; the point of the problem is different at different stages. Movement can be reflected through indicators.  
3 Self-contained: problems generally have larger problems or sub-problems. It is crucial to filter out the problems that you solve and that you can solve well.  
4 Measurable: the severity of the problem can be measured  
5 Relatedness: problems may be related or causal to each other and need to be considered for its underlying proposition 

## How to see/discover problems

> Any noun has a structure  
> Any verb has a process  
> any adjective has measure  

Phenomenon/new concept (structure) -> side effects of existing solutions, multidimensional thinking (insight, history) -> sorting out indicators (metrics to measure the severity of the problem, now) -> discovering opportunities (essence) -> planning (future)
