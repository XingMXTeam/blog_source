### Learning Methods

721 Principle: The "721" learning rule was formally introduced by Morgan, Robert and Mike in their book "Building a Career Development Plan", and is summarized as follows.

* 70% learning by doing (practice)
* 20% learning from others (review, summarize, share and exchange)  
* 10% self-learning (input: training, books)  

The methodology is simple.  
* * input **: what quality sources of information you have, this needs to be consciously collected, more books, training, join the bullying platform, contact more people, but also have an open mind  
**MEMORY UNDERSTANDING**: Summarize and refine through structured thinking/charts/thought maps, and strengthen your memory through card tools like Anki. Have a structure in your mind, just like a library can index at any time  
**expression use**: learn from sharing through articles and communicating with others. Participate in work, learn from projects, learn from solving real problems, learn from teaching others knowledge. Can reinforce and complement your refinement  

### Growth Model

What do you have to learn once you have a growth approach? This is the growth model. It contains two aspects one is soft skills and one is hard skills.

Soft skills are mainly communication and persuasion skills. Daily work is mainly with the help of documents, PPT (generally need to speak) and so on.  
1 documents should be less adjectives, no nonsense, to have the main line and structure  
2 PPT is generally a combination of speech, PPT generally accounts for 30%, 70% by speech to say. When making PPT pay attention to these points: 1 font (strong contrast) 1 big picture (funny diagram philosophical words Do not get a very large structure diagram) 3 colors (the same color, level gradient), general diagram > table > word; and the speech has several points    

* need to consider the audience, try not to be too in-depth at the beginning, need to introduce the background knowledge  
* In order to avoid tension, you can slow down the speed, just like chatting  
* The topic should not be loose, around the main line gradually in-depth  
* Interact appropriately in the middle, and answer questions for the public, not the questioner. If the questions are not within the scope or tricky, you can record them and communicate with them individually after the meeting.  

And hard skills, different positions are not quite the same. For programmers, if you are not a technical manager or architect, then only need to consider  
1 basic knowledge: underlying principles, operating systems, programming languages, algorithms, data structures, data, networks, security  
2 software engineering: design patterns, specifications, logging, single test, fault recovery, program advantages and disadvantages of comparison, technology selection, agile development  
3 programming capabilities: performance, scalability, maintenance costs, robustness

Off-topic.  
About depth and breadth: growing up under a platform, you don't have to know everything, all know the details. Some things, just know what problems it solves, this is the breadth, depth is you need to understand all the details of your industry, it is your core competencies, breadth and depth is not separated, breadth can sometimes strengthen your depth. In the competitive field, individuals are also a product, to weaken their weaknesses and fully highlight your competitiveness
About hard work: don't cheat yourself, recognize your strengths and do what you love in your field

### Needs analysis

After you have the ability, you need to solve the actual problem. Only then can you maximize your value. The software engineering dimension is requirements analysis. First I'll throw out a methodology: 5W2H model
> 5W2H analysis, also known as the Seven Questions Analysis, was pioneered by the U.S. Army Ordnance Repair Department in World War II. It is simple, convenient, easy to understand, easy to use, enlightening, widely used in business management and technical activities, and is also very helpful for decision-making and implementation of activity measures, and also helps to make up for omissions in consideration of the problem.

* why: why to do this work  
* what: what the content is  
* where: where to do it  
* when: when to do it  
* who: who will do it  
* how: how to do it  
* how much: how much time and resources it will take  

The essence of **why** is to define the problem.  
Without a clear definition of the problem, decisions cannot be made, and good results, such as great products and solutions, cannot be produced. Albert Einstein once said.
> It is more important to ask a question than to solve a problem.

The essence of a problem is the contradiction of things that do not match

There are several general characteristics.  
1 Universality: is ordinary existence  
2 Kinematic: in constant flux, what is now a problem may later become not a problem or a problem becomes another
         Different stages, different problem points. Through the indicators can reflect the movement, time and space to evolve
3 self-contained: problems generally have larger problems or sub-problems. It is critical to filter out the problems that need to be solved by you and can be solved well.  
4 Measurable: The severity of the problem can be measured  
5 Relevance: Problems may be related or causal and need to consider its underlying proposition  

How to solve the problem.  
Methodology.
> Any noun has a structure  
> Any verb has a process  
> Any adjective has a measure  

Steps.  
1 Phenomenon/new concept (structure)  
2 Existing program side effects, multidimensional thinking (insight, history)  
3 Sorting through metrics (metrics of the severity of the problem, now)  
5 Identify opportunities (essence)  
6 Planning (future)  

Off-topic.  
We often talk about structured thinking. In fact, and software engineering inside the requirements analysis is very similar, that is, to break down a broad requirement, multi-dimensional to think. There are several levels of thinking, the level of abstraction rising: ** base: ** is critical thinking, analytical thinking, innovative thinking, metacognition, abstract thinking (pyramid principles + deliberate practice), etc.; ** advanced ** is structured thinking: thinking from multiple sides, profound analysis of the causes of the problem, the system to develop a plan of action, and finally complete the work; ** upper level ** is product thinking, business thinking, etc.

### Influence building

If your product solves the problem. Then how to sell this product to other students. You need to tell your story well.
Let's throw in a theory first: the SCQA model

S (Situation) Scenario - introduced by a familiar scenario, a fact.  
C (Complication) Conflict - the actual situation often conflicts with what we want.  
Q (Question) question - what to do?  
A (Answer) Answer - Our solution is  

Make things clear through structured expressions.
