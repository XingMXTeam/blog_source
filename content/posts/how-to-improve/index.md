## Cognitive system

First of all one cannot grow without one's cognition, of which I am a firm believer. Only if you know, you will want to gap. With cognition, it is easier to find opportunities. Building a good cognition requires two preconditions: a powerful platform (insight) + an open mind (growth)

To give two examples of cognitive enhancement for me, so to speak: one is about competitiveness, growing under a platform without having to know everything, all knowing the details. There are some things, just know what problem it solves. Depth is more important than breadth, it is your core competency. In the competitive field, protect your dead center and strengthen your competitiveness. Start with your opponent's dead center and break through their competitiveness. Another is the view of things, need to look at the four dimensions, history, the present, the essence, the future. From history can glimpse the future, the current is at which stage, how it evolves, what is the essence of the problem, for example, the product, what are you trying to meet the user's demand? In fact, this and [how to define the question](/how-to-define-question/) is essentially the same thing.  

About how to grow, I think you need to from the following 4 aspects  
1 Learning methods  
2 Structured thinking  
3 Growth model  
4 Self-awareness  

### Learning method

According to the 721 principle: The "721" learning rule was formally introduced by Morgan, Robert and Mike in their book "Constructing a Career Development Plan" and is summarized as follows.

* 70% learning by doing (practice)
* 20% learning from others (communication, review, summary)  
* 10% self-learning (input: training, books)  

From these three perspectives, the first proportion of the highest, the main is to participate in the work, learning from the project, learning from solving practical problems, learning from teaching others knowledge; the second learning to summarize, through structured thinking summary refinement, through the card tool such as Anki, to strengthen memory, through the sharing of articles in the exchange of learning; the third point is mainly input, what quality sources of information you have, this needs to be consciously collected, more books, training, etc.

### What is structured thinking

There are several levels of thinking:**base:** critical thinking, analytical thinking, innovative thinking, metacognition, abstract thinking (pyramid principles + deliberate practice), etc.;**advanced** is structured thinking: thinking from multiple sides, profound analysis of the causes of the problem, the system to develop a plan of action, and finally complete the work;**upper level** is product thinking, business thinking, etc.

How to do structured thinking it: the main thing is to focus on these points

* There is logic: time + space multi-dimensional view
* Methodology: 5W2H model
  * why: why do this work  
  * what: what is the content  
  * where: where to do  
  * when: when to do it  
  * who: who will do it  
  * how: how to do it  
  * how much: how much time and resources it will take  

### Growth Model

There are two areas: soft skills and hard skills.

Soft skills I understand is mainly communication, persuasion ability. Daily work is mainly with the help of documents, PPT (generally need to speak), etc.. Documents to less adjectives, no nonsense, to have the main line and structure; PPT is generally a combination of speeches, PPT generally accounted for 30%, 70% by the speech to say. When making PPT pay attention to these points: 1 kind of font (strong contrast) 1 big picture (funny picture philosophical words do not get a very big structure picture) 3 kinds of colors (the same color, level gradient), general figure > table > word; and speech has several points  
1 need to consider the audience, try not to be too in-depth at the beginning, need to introduce the background knowledge  
2 in order to avoid tension, you can slow down the speed, just like chatting  
3 Topics should not be loose, around the main line gradually in-depth  
4 You can interact appropriately in the middle, and answer questions for the public, not the questioner. Not in the scope or tricky questions, you can record, and communicate individually after the meeting.  

And hard skills, different positions are not quite the same. For programmers, if you are not a technical manager or architect, then only need to consider  
1 basic knowledge: underlying principles, operating systems, programming languages, algorithms, data structures, data, networks, security  
2 software engineering: design patterns, specifications, logging, single test, fault recovery, program advantages and disadvantages of comparison, technology selection, agile development  
3 Programming skills: performance, scalability, maintenance costs, robustness  

### Self-awareness

General personal ability is very strong also does not necessarily make great achievements, very strong ability is ultimately expressed in the influence, influence where to come, through the speech, documents, products, viewpoint output, etc., and these need you to have a better knowledge of yourself, there is no corresponding characteristics:.  
1 enthusiasm + confidence: follow the passion within, strong cognitive have formed their own views, and the courage to express their views  
2 big picture: strong cognition to see the larger world, see the current node of the trend, leverage the power to jump up  
3 action: technical accumulation can let you write good code, continuous coding can build more products; write articles (PPT + speech), correct errors, and then output can form their own methodology
