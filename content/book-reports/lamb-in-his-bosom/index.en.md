It is mainly a depiction of farmers living in Georgia, USA, before the outbreak of the Civil War.
They were not plantation owners, nor were they capitalists. Just ordinary people living on a piece of land, needing to feed themselves, fighting against the harsh living conditions, working hard for the need to feed their families, for their families and children, reflecting the different destinies of each person, living a cold and warm life.

## What I Liked

- The depiction of the natural scenery of Georgia, USA is awesome and gave me a desire to see it in the field.
- No earth-shattering plot descriptions. Talking about life from the point of view and gradually bringing you into the emotion, this may also be a way to make people feel comfortable

## What I Disliked
