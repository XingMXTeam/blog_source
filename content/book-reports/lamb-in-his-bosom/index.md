It is mainly a depiction of farmers living in Georgia, USA, before the outbreak of the Civil War.
They were not plantation owners, nor were they capitalists. Just ordinary people living on a piece of land, needing to feed themselves, fighting against the harsh living conditions, working hard for the need to feed their families, for their families and children, reflecting the different fates of each person, living a cold and warm life.

## What I Liked

* Description of the natural environment

## What I Disliked

* The bland description of life lacks the winning plot of a novel.
* The ending is rather rushed
