GPT is underestimated and the age of intelligence will eventually come. Individuals will also be greatly empowered

## What GPT can do

- It can teach, it can solve problems.
- Selflessness , patience
- Ability to analogise , predict , step by step outputs

Ability to:
- Understanding complex ideas: language translation, translation of tone and style, cross-domain translation, GTP4 can understand complex ideas (e.g. understand human jokes)
- Spatial comprehension: gpt+ combined with stable diffision outputs images that meet expectations
- Visual ability: visual ability from text, drawing miniatures from text
- 3d modelling skills
- Code comprehension: combining tools to realise intent through multiple steps (solution provided)
- Mathematical ability: correct solution
- Interacting with the world: calling api's and sending emails, browsing the web
- Physical interaction: can't actually see or perform actions, but can interface through language and can perform needs to understand environment, tasks, actions and feedback.
- Interacting with humans: reasoning about others mental states strong

## Flaws of GPT

Lack of planning in text generation, poorly done mental arithmetic: limitations of autoregressive models
Models are cured once trained, cannot learn quickly or from experience (induction, solipsistic reasoning)

## How to interact with GPT
1 Structuring of unstructured data
2 one shot: knowledge + known; solution


## What are the future opportunities
Opportunities for AI: rapid digitisation, reducing the cost of physical modelling (unstructured -> structured). Everything can be done from the assistant's point of view, from the point of view of solving problems, not from the point of view of so-called cheapness.


## Scenario characteristics:

Broad, high-frequency, fast feedback, clear purpose function, low to medium decision dimension

Why Jitterbug beats Racer: let the lady post videos quickly via video + audio, not via algorithms. 

## Why GPT is so great.

GPT is opportunity based on probability and features, not on markers. For example: I'm in Beijing Tian (Anmen) Tian (gas) (pattern recognition or called compression, with a multi-layer structure, language carries all the wisdom of mankind)

Currently there are 2 categories:

1, fine-tune: tuning (without marking)   

2„ÄÅHypertext model: knowledge base No tuning  

long-chain ?
